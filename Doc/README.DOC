2. PRINTING THE MANUAL

You can print the manual either by sending main.ps to a postscript
printer, by using ghostscript to convert main.ps into the format that
your printer understands, or by using some program designed to convert
.dvi format into the format that your printer understands.  If none of
this means anything to you, then use the plain-text version of the
manual, main.txt.

processing main.i with

You will need to run off a copy of the manual.  The procedure for
doing this will depend both on the kind of printer you are using and
on the kind of computer you are using.  

2.1. Which file is appropriate for your printer?

The distribution includes several versions of the manual, each
formatted in a different way.  These include:

  File                  Format

  main.ps               postscript (Apple Laserwriter, etc)
  main.dvi              TeX .dvi format

If your printer appears in the list above, choose the appropriate
file.  If your printer does not appear in the list, but you know about
TeX, you can generate a version for your own printer from the
"main.dvi" file.  Otherwise, send me email (rogers@anthro.utah.edu)
and I will either generate a version of the manual for your printer or
else send you hard copy.

2.2 Printing the file

Unless you are on a Macintosh, you can print the manual by sending the
relevant file to your printer using the command that you always use.
For example,

  Operating system    Command

  Berkeley Unix       lpr main.dvi-jep
  AT&T Unix           lp main.dvi-jep
  DOS                 copy /b main.dvi-jep prn:
                   or copy /b main.dvi-jep lpt1:
                      copy main.dvi-alw prn:
                   or copy main.dvi-alw lpt1:

Note that under DOS, the /b flag is needed if you are using
main.dvi-jep but not if you are using main.dvi-alw.

2.2.1. Problems

* You will get garbage under DOS if you fail to use the /b flag when
printing main.dvi-jep.

* The manual may fail to print correctly if your printer does not have
much memory.

* If you are on a Mac, and you do the obvious thing, your printer will
probably generate page after page of postscript instructions rather
using the postscript instructions to generate the manual.  This is
because the Mac does not send the file to the printer "as is", but
wraps it in a package that tells the printer to treat the file not as
instructions but as data.  To print postscript on a Mac, you have to
use a special program that does not come with the operating system.
The relevant program is available over the net on various shareware
archives.  I believe its name is "send-ps".
