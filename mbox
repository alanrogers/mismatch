Dear Dr Rogers

Thanks for the mismatch2b info. I having a few problems as follows:

The program makemm dosen't seem to be able to read a phylip data file.
It seem to be finding the character "K" in the phylip file when its

apus$ makemm austro.phy > austro.dat

Illegal data value in subject "cby95h1": "K"
 
was the error message I got

Also, when I ran the command "latex mkfig" latex did not finish cleanly
but fell over. I append the log file as follows

Alan:  thanks for the message.  I just read your Evolution paper (received
my copy of the journal today) and got access to the mismatch program, which
I'll try on a couple of large haplotype data sets I have on some Amazonian
rodents as soon as I figure out how to compile it.  Looks like a very
interesting approach, but I am an empiricist not a theoretist.  The e-mail
address you have for Monty Slatkin is a correct one, but if he doesn't
answer, I can hand deliver your message.
Thanks,
Jim Patton

Alan:  Without doubt due to our general incompetence, but we are seemingly
unable to get a compiled version of your Mismatch program package working.
Computer environments available to us are PowerMac and PC.  Is there any
way that you might be able to provide an executable verision for either of
these platforms?  We also have access to Unix through a Sun SparcStation,
but would have to learn how to use the system first.  Any help,
suggestions, or other commenst would be most welcome.
Thanks,
Jim Patton
