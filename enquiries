Dr. Rogers,
 I am a Ph.D. student in genetics at UC Davis.  I recently read your 1995
 paper published in Evolution.  I would like to use your Mismatch program
 to evaluate white seabass data I have.  I tried the anonymous ftp
 mentioned in the paper and your source code from the anthropology
 website.  I had no luck with either.  Do you have a recent version that
 you would let me use?

 Thank you,
 Katharine Coykendall
