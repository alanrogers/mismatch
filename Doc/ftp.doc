Read.me FILE FOR ANONYMOUS FTP, ANTHRO.UTAH.EDU

1. INTRODUCTION

This document describes the files that are available via anonymous ftp
from anthro.utah.edu.

The suffix of a filename indicates the format in which the file is
written.  For example, the suffix ".ps" indicates that the file
"continuity.ps" is written in Postscript format.  The suffix ".*"
indicates that several formats are available.  For example,
"continuity.*" refers to several files: continuity.ps, continuity.dvi,
and continuity.hp.  Read section 3 of this document to figure out
which format is appropriate for you.

Section 2 of this document describes the files that are available.  

Section 3 describes file formats.

Section 4 provides instructions for using anonymous ftp.

4. USING ANONYMOUS FTP

1. Type "ftp anthro.utah.edu".  This connects you to the server at the
Department of Anthropology, University of Utah.  If it does not,
consult your computer guru or ask me (rogers@anthro.utah.edu) to mail
you a hard copy of the file you are interested in.

2. You will see some irrelevant information followed by a prompt that
looks something like this:

     Name (anthro.utah.edu:rogers):

After the colon, type "anonymous" (don't type the quotes) and hit return. 

3. After more irrelevant information, you will see:

      Password:

After the colon, type your complete internet address and hit return.
For example, I would type "rogers@anthro.utah.edu".

4. You will see:

      ftp>

You are now connected to ftp.

5. Type "cd pub" to get into the public directory.

If you wish, type "ls" to get a list of available files.  You can also
type "?" to get a list of available commands.

6. If the file you want ends with .tar, .dvi, or .Z, it must be
transferred in "binary" mode.  To enter binary mode, type "binary" and
hit return.  Do not use binary mode with files ending with .tex, .txt,
or .ps.

7. To download a file named "foo.ps", type "get foo.ps".  Ftp will
tell you when it has finished downloading the file.

8. Type "quit" and hit return to get out of ftp.

These instructions are for the version of ftp that runs under unix.
Other versions are so similar that it isn't usually necessary to read
the manual.

9. Once you have the file on your machine, you will want to send it to
your printer.  The commands for doing this differ among operating
systems.  Here are a few examples, each assuming that the file you
want to print is called foo.ps:
 
  On Berkeley UNIX:  lpr foo.ps
 
  On AT&T UNIX:      lp foo.ps
 
  On MSDOS:          copy /b foo.ps prn:
   or maybe:         print foo.ps
 
  On Macintosh:      The Mac tries to ensure that ordinary users never
                     see the postscript code that its text processing
                     software generates.  The result is that even
                     though postscript is the Mac's native language,
                     you need a special program to send a postscript
                     file to the printer.  Look for a program named
                     psprint, printps, send-ps, or something similar.
